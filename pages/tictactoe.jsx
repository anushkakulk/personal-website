          <h2 className="py-2">Overview</h2>
          <p className="py-2 ">
            While studying Robotic Science and Systems, I had the opportunity to
            apply what I was learning regarding kinematics, computer vision,
            path planning, and homogenous transformations and build a cool
            project. Landing on a tictactoe playing robot arm, I worked with a
            team of developers to make this fun prospect a reality! The major
            task of getting the robot to play was split into 4 manageable tasks,
            focusing on Computer Vision (Task: Detect the drawn board, X’s and
            O’s, and update an internal gamestate), Manipulation (Task: Program
            the Robot to draw a recognizable O shape), Interfacing Computer
            Vision and Manipulation (Task: Find the transformation from board in
            camera’s frame to board in robot’s frame), and Optimal Move (Task:
            Use a minimax algorithm that will always choose the best open square
            for the robot to make its next move based on CV parsed gamestate).
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 ">
            Challenges were certainly present, especially when it came to the
            computer vision aspect of the project. Rather than opting for a
            convolutional neural network to train the robot to recognize the
            shapes, we decided to use more traditional CV to detect the board,
            X’s and O’s. This was a great learning experience as I was able to
            understand the limitations of traditional CV, as a lot of the time,
            the robot would not be able to detect the board or the pieces when
            moved to different locations with different lighting, needing on the
            fly changes to pre-processing thresholds. Similarly, the robot
            itself was a challenge to work with, as the robot arm was not as
            precise as I would have liked, leading to a lot of trial and error
            when it came to drawing the O’s. The inverse kinematics to determine
            the location of the end effector gets calculated correctly, yet as
            the end effector moves further from its base, the error in the end
            effector’s location increases. Regardless, the project was a great
            success, and I was able to learn a lot about being adaptable when
            faced with challenges, in addition to robotics, computer vision, and
            software development in the process!
