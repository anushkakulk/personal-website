          <h2 className="py-2">Overview</h2>
          <p className="py-2 ">
            While studying object oriented design practices, I developed a Java
            implementation of the popular board game Reversi/Othello on a
            hexagonal board. I followed the Model View Controller paradigm,
            which allowed for loose coupling between components, efficient unit
            and integration tests/debugging, and naturally, encapsulation. The
            hexagonal board was designed with Java Swing GUI components. Overall
            the design resulted in a modular and maintanable system, allowing
            for extensibility (added multiple extra features without changing
            existing code! like hints on the GUI view, new AI strategies, etc.)
          </p>
          <p>
            The gameplay is designed to cater to various player types,
            supporting both human and AI players with distinct and customizable
            strategies. The codebase follows organization with packages
            structured around key interfaces such as model, view, controller,
            and player.

              Notable Patterns and Design Paradigms, complementing the MVC
              architecture, include:
            </p>
            <li>
              <strong>Strategy Pattern:</strong> Enables flexible,
              interchangeable, and composite algorithms for different AI player
              strategies.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Observer Pattern:</strong> Facilitates communication
              between components, ensuring efficient updates.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Delegate Pattern:</strong> Employs delegation for modular
              and reusable code structures.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Factory Pattern:</strong> Parses Command Line Inputs to
              enhance player object creation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Adapter Pattern:</strong> Bridges incompatible interfaces,
              allowing for clean interaction.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Decorator Pattern:</strong> Dynamically attaches
              additional responsibilities to objects (like adding a hint option
              to the view), promoting extensibility.
            </li>
          </ul>

            This amalgamation of a well-structured MVC architecture, diverse
            player strategies, and an intuitive GUI demonstrates my ability to
            transform intricate concepts into cohesive and captivating software
            solutions. This project has not only enhanced my technical
            proficiency but has also inspired me to seek out more fun and
            meaningful endeavors to apply my classroom knowledge!
